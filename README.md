# Plugins-for-the-Betterment-of-UI
An Open Source Project for creating Plugins to improve the UI expierence for animators across several platforms.

So far I only have one program ready (which isn't even _technically_ a plugin but sssshhhh) but here's how to use it!:

**Step 1**:

  Go to the Github page and copy the ccontents of "Spirals.py"
  Next, open up Maya and click on the script editor on the far bottom right of the screen

**Step 2**:
  
  Click the "+" icon to open a new code tab.
  Note: I already have some scripts open hence the multiple tabs, if you only see one or two, that's ok

**Step 3**:

  In the pop-up that appears, select the "Python" option to open up a Python tab.
  Copy and paste "Spirals.py" into this new python tab. To run it, within the tab press CTRL+A to select all the code, then CTRL+ENTER to run it.
